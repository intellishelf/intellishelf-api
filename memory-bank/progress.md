# Project Progress - Intellishelf API

## Current System Status ✅
**Everything works locally, ready for next features**

### What's Fully Functional
- ✅ **User Authentication**: Registration, login, JWT + refresh tokens
- ✅ **Book Management**: Full CRUD operations with pagination and sorting
- ✅ **File Storage**: Book cover upload via Azure Blob storage
- ✅ **AI Integration**: Book metadata parsing from text
- ✅ **Data Layer**: Clean architecture with proper separation

### Development Environment
- ✅ Local development setup working
- ✅ Database integration functional
- ✅ All core APIs responding correctly
- ❌ Production deployment (not prioritized yet)

## Architecture Achievements

### Phase 1: Foundation (2024)
- ✅ Clean Architecture setup (Api/Domain/Data/Common)
- ✅ TryResult error handling pattern
- ✅ Dependency injection structure
- ✅ Basic testing framework

### Phase 2: Core Features (Late 2024)
- ✅ User authentication with JWT
- ✅ Book CRUD operations
- ✅ File upload and storage
- ✅ AI-powered book parsing

### Phase 3: Enhancement (Late 2024)
- ✅ Refresh token system with rotation
- ✅ Pagination and sorting for book collections
- ✅ Background services for maintenance
- ✅ Azure Blob integration

## Next Development Phase

### Immediate Priorities
1. **ISBN Search** - External API integration for book lookup
   1. Add sort title (without the, a, an, hardcoded list of them)
   2. Use two separate ISBNs
2. **Integration Tests** - Comprehensive API testing
3. **Code Quality** - Review and refactor where needed

### Future Considerations
- Production deployment strategy
- Mobile app integration
- Advanced search capabilities
- AI chat functionality (longer term)

## Technical Patterns That Work
- **TryResult Pattern**: Consistent error handling across all services
- **Clean Architecture**: Clear separation between layers
- **Mapper Pattern**: Clean data transformation between layers
- **Background Services**: Reliable for scheduled tasks
- **Azure Integration**: Smooth file storage integration

## Known Technical State
- **Performance**: Good for development scale, untested at production scale
- **Security**: JWT implementation solid, refresh token rotation working
- **Scalability**: Architecture supports growth, not stress-tested
- **Maintainability**: Clean code structure, good separation of concerns
