# Implementation Plan: [FEATURE]

**Branch**: `[###-feature-name]` | **Date**: [DATE] | **Spec**: [link]
**Input**: Feature specification from `/specs/[###-feature-name]/spec.md`

**Note**: This template is filled in by the `/speckit.plan` command. See `.specify/templates/commands/plan.md` for the execution workflow.

## Summary

[Extract from feature spec: primary requirement + technical approach from research]

## Technical Context

<!--
  ACTION REQUIRED: Replace the content in this section with the technical details
  for the project. The structure here is presented in advisory capacity to guide
  the iteration process.
-->

**Language/Version**: .NET 8+ with C# latest stable  
**Primary Dependencies**: ASP.NET Core, MongoDB.Driver, Azure.Storage.Blobs [or NEEDS CLARIFICATION]  
**Storage**: MongoDB for data, Azure Blob Storage for files [or N/A]  
**Testing**: xUnit with Moq, Testcontainers for integration tests  
**Target Platform**: Linux containers (Docker) or Azure App Service [or NEEDS CLARIFICATION]
**Project Type**: Multi-project .NET solution (API + Domain + Data + Common)  
**Performance Goals**: [domain-specific, e.g., <200ms API response p95 or NEEDS CLARIFICATION]  
**Constraints**: [domain-specific, e.g., startup-friendly pragmatic approach or NEEDS CLARIFICATION]  
**Scale/Scope**: [domain-specific, e.g., small to medium user base, startup context or NEEDS CLARIFICATION]

## Constitution Check

*GATE: Must pass before Phase 0 research. Re-check after Phase 1 design.*

- [ ] **Modern .NET Stack**: Feature uses .NET 8+, ASP.NET Core, follows naming conventions
- [ ] **ProblemDetails Error Handling**: API errors return ProblemDetails with explicit status codes
- [ ] **TryResult Pattern**: Service/DAO layers use TryResult<T> for error propagation
- [ ] **Integration-First Testing**: API contracts and persistence changes have integration tests
- [ ] **Pragmatic Testing**: Unit tests included only for isolated validation/business logic
- [ ] **Layered Architecture**: Domain independent of Data/Api, interfaces in Domain, implementations in Data, no circular dependencies

*If any checks fail, provide justification in Complexity Tracking section below.*

## Complexity Tracking

> **Fill ONLY if Constitution Check has violations that must be justified**

| Violation | Why Needed | Simpler Alternative Rejected Because |
|-----------|------------|-------------------------------------|
| [e.g., 4th project] | [current need] | [why 3 projects insufficient] |
| [e.g., Repository pattern] | [specific problem] | [why direct DB access insufficient] |
